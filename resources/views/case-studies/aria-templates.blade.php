            <h3>1. Overview</h3>
            <p>Amadeus wanted to re-write their existing Aria Javascript framework, so as to re-architect around lessons learnt and make use of modern best practices.</p>
                &nbsp;

            <h3>2. The Context and Challenge</h3>

            <p>Challenges included coming to the project after 1 year of development and having to get up to speed with a very complex Javascript framework very quickly.</p>

            <p>My role as a senior developer was to consult with customers (business owners), and transform their requirements into features.</p>
